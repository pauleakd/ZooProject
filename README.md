# ZooProject

This is a project I completed after 2 weeks learning of Object Oriented Programming in Java, using test driven development.

The task included:

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings.
MVP

The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!


Project Extensions:

    Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
    Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left.
    View the total income for the zoo.
    Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures
